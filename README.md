# discord-rollybot-jr

This program is intended to do the following:
  - Create a dice roller as random as I can create for use in remote "tabletop role-playing games"
  - Help recreate the suspense of the whole table by having a "dramatic pause between rolls"
  - Add some levity to the table by having easter eggs show up on occasion whilst rolling

This program is intended to help me get used to, learn, and practice the following:
  - committing to an external repository (get used to)
  - The secrets module in python (learn)
  - The discord.py module in python (learn)
  - Documenting the entire process of developing an application (practice)

Oh and Hello World!
